<p>The relatively recent mainstream availability of complex algorithms and computationally efficient hardware is creating a platform for new innovations never before available to the scientific computing world. Since the development of computer systems, computing times have been drastically reduced, making more complex computations feasible. The continuous cycle of improvements in computation speeds and hardware leading to ever more complex computations can be seen in the scaling of hardware to meet these more complex computation goals. A resolution to this cycle can be found in the utilization of GPU’s in high-performance computing for Machine learning and deep learning algorithms.<br>
Most of the complex computing strategies can be simplified into basic linear algebra operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, inversion and such. Out of the listed operations, matrix multiplication and inversion are the most computationally expensive operations.</p>
<p>Most matrix operations are performed sequentially in CPU cores and the computation time scales with the size of the matrix as a factor $ \theta(n^3) $. Hence, computation cycles and duration of time to be allocated towards computation is proportional to the size of matrices under the constrained hardware with limited cache memory and RAM. The same problem still exists with multicore systems or distributed systems due to the threshold on the resources mentioned. On the other hand, a GPU is composed of several thousand cores, combining to provide the user with several GBs of computational memory compared to the MBs provided by CPU cache memory. The distributed computing this configuration provides enables parallelism across the cores and allows a super fast flow of data because of super huge bandwidth. This distribution across multiple cores amounts to massively reduced computation time as the device is able to scale its performance with the data size.</p>
<p>The enormous gains in computation time should give researchers a valid reason to switch from CPUs to GPUs for computationally heavy operations where the CPU-based operations do not scale with the data at a constant rate. Utilization of this methodology will provide enormous benefits for the computationally heavy domains such as machine learning, deep learning, linear algebra, optimization, data structures etc. To illustrate this statement, we’ve included benchmarking using intensive linear algebra operations i.e. Matrix multiplication and Matrix-inversion on CPU vs GPU demonstrated further in this code.</p>
<p>The CPU version was deployed on a multicore processor with 16 cores and 64GB RAM memory with Numpy arrays in python. The GPU Version was deployed on NVIDIA Tesla K40 with 11GB GPU memory with Tensorflow.  Here the cpu implementations were carried with two different types of numpy compilations. mkl_mul stands for multiplication operation carried with numpy compiled with math kernel library. Nomkl_mul stands for the numpy without math kernel library. mkl based numpy was installed in anaconda enviroment with conda install numpy whereas the numpy installed with pip doesn’t integrate math kernel library. Xena has nodes with single GPU and dual GPU. Dual GPU node offers users 2x11GB of computational GPU memory which allows to use a larger batch size and double the size of cores for faster implementation of highly complex  models which has a large number of parameters. the GPU_mul corresponds to multiplication operations carried with single GPU nodes and dualgpu_mul corresonds to the one carried with dual  GPU node. Another interesting benchmarking is carried for inversion operation for the similar cases as done for multiplication</p>

<p>Tensorflow is an open source deep learning library provided by Google. It provides primitives for functions definitions on tensor and a mechanism to compute their derivatives automatically. It uses a tensor to represent any multidimensional array of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Comparision between Numpy and Tensorflow</strong></p>
<p>TensorFlow’s computational housing is a tensor, similar to Numpy’s housing of data in Ndarray’s making both of them N-d array libraries.</p>
<p>However, Numpy does not offer a method to create tensor functions and automatically compute derivatives, nor does it support GPU implementation. Thus, for processing data of higher dimensions,<br>
Tensorflow outperforms Numpy array due to its GPU implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Numpy vs Tensorflow Implementations</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Numpy Implementation of Matrix Addition</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>    import numpy as np
    a=np.zeros((2,2))
    b=np.zeros((2,2))
    np.sum(b,axis=0)
    a.shape
    np.reshape(b,(1,3))
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Tensorflow Implementation of Matrix Addition</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>    import tensorflow as tf 
    tf.InteractiveSession()
    a=tf.zeros((2,2))
    b=tf.ones((2,2))
    tf.reduce_sum(b,reduction_indices=1).eval()
    a.get_shape()
    tf.reshape(b,(1,3)).eval()
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that tensorflow requires explicit evaluation i.e tensorflow computation defines a computational graph which only gets initialized with values after a session has been evaluated.</p>
<p>example. For numpy</p>
<pre><code>    a=np.zeros((2,2)) ; print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>immediately gives value of a .</p>
<p>However for tensorflow</p>
<pre><code>    a=tf.zeros((2,2))
    print(ta) 
</code></pre>
<p>doesn’t return the value until</p>
<pre><code>           print(ta.eval())
</code></pre>
<p>So It is important to understand how tensorflow works and initializes it’s environment</p>
<p>Tensorflow uses session object which encapsulates the environment in which the tensors are evaluated.</p>
<p>A tf session for performing multiplication is demonstrated below:</p>
<pre><code>    a= tf.constant(9999999)
    b=tf.constant(111111111)
    c=a*b
    with tf.session() as sess:
         print(sess.run(c))
         print(c.eval())
</code></pre>
<p>Tensorflow firstly structures the programs, creates a graph integrating the variables and uses session to exectute the process.<br>
Tensorflow Variable:<br>
Similar to other programming language variables, tensorflow uses a varaible object to store and update the parameters. They are stored in memory buffers that contains tensors. TensorFlow variables must be initialized before they have  values! Contrast with constant tensors</p>
<pre><code>    W=tf.Variable(tf.zeros((2,2)), name=&quot;weights&quot;)
    R=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((2,2)), name=&quot;Random_weights&quot;)

    with tf.session() as sess:
           sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
        print(sess.run(W))
        print(sess.run(R))
</code></pre>
<p>Converting numpy data to tensor</p>
<pre><code>    a=np.zeros((3,3))
    t_a=tf.convert_to_tensor(a)
    with tf.session() as sess:
        print(sess.run(t_a))
</code></pre>
<p>For scalable variables for performing operations we can use <code>tf.placeholder</code> which defines a placeholder and provides entry points for the data to be viewed in a computational graph.  <code>feed_dict</code> is used in the below example to map from tf.placeholder vars to data(np arrays,list,etc)</p>
<pre><code>    input1= tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
    input2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
    output = tf.mul(input1, input2)
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        print(sess.run([output], feed_dict={input1:[7.], input2:[2.]}))</code></pre>
